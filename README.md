# Chip-8
## A simple CHIP-8 emulator.

This is a simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C++. It was originally written as a proof of concept for an emulation technique
so it isn't particularly polished, but you're more than welcome to improve it.

For more info on CHIP-8 see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8.

## Running on Windows
Open the Visual Studio 2015 solution and set the startup project to __runChip-8__. Set the command line to point to
a CHIP-8 ROM file and run it.

## Running on Linux
Not implemented. However, given the simplicitly of the source, it should be fairly easy to port, and I may yet return to it.

## ROMs
You can download CHIP-8 ROMs from http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html.
